# Arithmetic with String
This project can manipulate number strings, to more precisely perform calculations.

I see a lot of people wondering why the number 9999999999999999 turns into 10000000000000000.

That happens because of various problems, there are memory problems, limitations in the programming language used, and many other factors.

That's why I created this project, I want to help myself and everyone who needs the functionality that I will create. Even though it's possible that someone has created a project like me but didn't share it or maybe someone has shared it but it's less/unpopular. I'm not sure either.
